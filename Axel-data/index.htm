		<h5><b>Quantum vs MEMS</b> utility </h5>
		<p>This data-processing utility is design to accommodate simultaneous 
		quantum interferometer signal with MEMS signal measuring vibrations in 
		the same direction.</p>
		<p>When these two signals are plotted against each other a fringe 
		pattern should appear. After fitting a cosine function to it, the 
		parameters of the fit should give us the average acceleration during the 
		measurement period (minutes). The difference of that average estimated 
		acceleration to the average MEMS acceleration&nbsp; (measurement for the 
		same period of time) can be used as compensation of MEMS drift. </p>
		<p>After loading the log file of the measurement, the data are processed 
		by sections (segments). You can process the data section by section with 
		Section Scroll buttons and Fit Single buttons OR you can Run Scan, which 
		will take sections in series and show the fit and the the trend bellow.</p>
		<p>The utility provides a simulation mode (with noise) for training and 
		testing as well.</td>

		<h5>Temperature compensation utility</h5>
		<p>It is well know the the major instability (drift) of MEMS 
		accelerometer is due to its dependence from temperature. This utility 
		provides a tool to estimate a correction (compensation) of that drift by 
		fitting a polynomial of different degree in trying to minimize the 
		fluctuations of measurements of immobile MEMS. </p>
		<p>After long enough measurements (days) the coefficients of the 
		polynomial can be a good estimation improving the MEMS accuracy with one 
		or two order of magnitude (x10 - x100).</p>
		<p>The residuals and histogram of the residuals are plotted for better 
		illustration of the fit. </td>

		<h5>Join Delay Optimization utility</h5>
		<p>The measurements of the quantum interferometer signal should match 
		(in time) the measurements of MEMS. In practice that requirement has 
		some error and this utility is designed to estimate the optimum delay of 
		what we think is the time difference of quantum vs MEMS signals to what 
		the actual time delay is. </p>
		<p>The two acceleration signals are compared with some variable delay 
		and the minimum difference is estimated. </p>
		<p>After loading the join file (*.jlg) and set the range and step for 
		the scan, pressing Delay Scan button will start the data processing.</p>
		<p>The bottom chart shows the differences point by point as the 
		cumulative difference for each delay is plotted on the top chart. The 
		minimum of top series is an estimation of the optimum delay we are 
		looking for.</p>
