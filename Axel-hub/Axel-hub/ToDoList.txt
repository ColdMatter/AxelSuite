===================

IMMEDIATE
- scan to change both (X/Y) phases in sequence (alternating), e.g. 0..5;0.5 -> phX=0; phY=0.5; phX=1...

- Jumbo Repeat will accept 

IN SOME POSSIBLE FUTURE
- scan will offer to scan individually X or Y or both alternating

- Time-out at wait4adjust loop in diagnostics

AxelHub
