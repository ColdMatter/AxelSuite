To Do In MotMaster2
===================

IMMEDIATE
- scan to change both (X/Y) phases in sequence (alternating), e.g. 0..5;0.5 -> phX=0; phY=0.5; phX=1...

- Jumbo Repeat will accept 

IN SOME POSSIBLE FUTURE
- scan will offer to scan individually X or Y or both alternating


AxelHub
==================

- regular check of the contrast, option for that
- count the disbalance into the quant. accel.

- config - quant - AxelProbe (only 0 order); MEMS - NI9251 
- tests
