		<h5>Direct control </h5>
		<p>The top button (Go Home and Horiz) will move both motors to home 
		position assign 0 to it then move to memorized positions of the 
		horizontal state (see Under the Hood) and assign 0 tilt to this 
		position. Now the system is ready to execute any movement which will 
		reproduce the movement made using the same initialize procedure.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p>Down and Up button along with the numerical field in between will 
		move incrementally with the step from the num. field. <br>
&nbsp;</p>
		<h5>Acceleration/Tilt Drift</h5>
		<p>Move repeatable or in single cycle following pattern from the combo 
		box. All the prameters bellow are to be understand in the contest of the 
		active pattern.</p>
		<p>The last (Periods Shown) will define how many periods will be shown 
		in the chart on the right.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
		<h5>Log panel</h5>
		<p>Log panel will show (if the checkbox Log is checked) the positions. 
		The movements are always linear, so the commands are define as 
		destinations from current position.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
		<h5>Connection</h5>
		<p>If the Axel-tilt is connected to other 
		application from the suite it will replay to position request which 
		taken from the controller and send to the application asking for it. </td>
