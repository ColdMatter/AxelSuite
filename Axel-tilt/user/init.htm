		<h5>Motors A/B</h5>
		<p>Two identical groups A 
		and B represent two motors moving (tilting) the platform. </p>
		<p>First button (<b>Initialize</b>) will move the motor to home position 
		(hardware fixed) and then assign 0 to this position. That way the system 
		can have reproducible initial position position. </p>
		<p>Next button (<b>Move [mm]</b>) and the numeric field after are for move the 
		respective motor to some position. The idea here is to motors to a 
		horizontal position of the platform. The horizontality is measured by 
		crossed level-meter. There are different types of such level-meters, but 
		even bubble one will do the job. These two positions (for horizontal 
		state) will be saved and after restart retrieved. </p>
		<p><b>Status</b> button will print in the log the status of the respective 
		motor taken from the controller. </p>
		<p>The last button (<b>[mm]</b>) will execute going home and move to retrieved 
		position in one click. When the system starts pressing both (in 
		sequence) buttons will recover the horizontal position.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
		<h5>Tilt</h5>
		<p>First button (<b>Initialize</b>) will execute initialization for motors A/B. Next button 
		(Move to preset...) will tilt the platform to&nbsp; the retrieved 
		positions (A/B) and then will assign 0 tilt to this tilt position. </p>
		<p><b>Move [mm]</b> button will move the platform to required tilt measured in 
		vertical displacement. Second (<b>Move [rad]</b>) will move the platform to 
		required tilt measured in radians. </p>
		<p><b>Stop</b> button is for emergency stop, if some dangerous actions are in 
		progress.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;</p>
		<h5>Options</h5>
		<p><b>Speed [mm/s] </b>allows to define the movement speed. 
		Usually following the manufacturer recommendations. 
		<p><b>Blacklash compensation</b> is integrated procedure to compensate the 
		backlash making any approach to a position only from one side. That 
		means if the default approach is up and the user moves down the 
		controller will move down pass the position with some predefine distance 
		and then move up in order to approach the position from up.&nbsp; 
		<p><b>MEMS correction</b> will switch On/Off the offset dodging parameter which 
		allows to make a final adjustment of the horizontality using the 
		electric signals for the MEMS.</td>
