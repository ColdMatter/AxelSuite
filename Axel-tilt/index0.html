<p align="left"><font face="Calibri" size="4">Axel Suite is a set of 
applications which together with MotMaster2 are the software for Navigator project, 
developed in Centre for Cold Matter,
Imperial College, London, UK.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Calibri" size="4">Last year our Navigator group , we demonstrated UK’s first quantum accelerometer which uses cold 
Rubidium-87 atoms for the precise measurement of acceleration. Our cold atoms 
are prepared in a magneto-optical trap (MOT), cooled down to a few microkelvin. 
This serves as the quantum source for our Mach-Zehnder interferometer where we 
use highly precise laser pulses to interact with the atoms. Any acceleration 
which effects the device during the interferometric process gets recorded and 
read out with a maximum measurement bandwidth of 10 Hz. A large dynamic range of 
operation can be achieved by combining the low drift signal of the atom 
interferometer with the higher dynamic measurement of a conventional MEMS 
accelerometer [1]. We have reached a horizontal acceleration sensitivity of 4
&#956;g 
(1g = 9.8 m/s<sup>2</sup>) in 1 sec of measurement integration time.</p>

<p align="left">The two major applications - 
MotMaster2 and Axel-hub, control and collect data from Navigator experiment. <br>
Another two applications - Axel-probe and Axel-tilt are designed to simulate in 
a different way acceleration conditions.</p>

Microsoft Visual C# 2013 with WPF visual components using Visual Studio 2013 
development environment.</p>
<p align="left">National Instruments Measurement 
Studio 2015 (scientific and graphical library - WPF edition) has been 
extensively used.</p>
